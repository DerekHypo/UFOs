#3. Summary

As I've spent some time using the webpage I think that I would like to have a search button.
Two additional recommendations for further development I would like to see would first be to fix the case sensitivity.
I noticed that the words in the search bars have to match the data. Some people my get confused or frustrated by this inconvenience.
The second would be adding a drop-down bar as a means to show the specific information on the website instead of just searching with the hopes of finding the information you are seeking.
